# TDD Coach

A program that helps people learn Test-Driven Development through katas with AI coaching.

## Description

The TDD Coach guides users through implementing coding katas using the Test-Driven Development approach. It follows the TDD cycle:

1. **PICK**: Select a test case to implement
2. **RED**: Write a failing test
3. **GREEN**: Write the minimal code to make the test pass
4. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

The application uses an LLM (Claude model from Anthropic) to provide personalized coaching feedback at each step of the process.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PORT=3000
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Follow the guided TDD process to implement the FizzBuzz kata
