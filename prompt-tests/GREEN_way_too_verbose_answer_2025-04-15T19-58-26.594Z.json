    "comments": "Great start! Your implementation is minimal and makes the test pass. You've returned the hardcoded string '1', which is exactly what's needed at this stage. It's clear, readable, and doesn't break any previously passing tests (since there aren't any yet). Remember, in TDD, we write the simplest code possible to make the test pass, and that's exactly what you've done here.",
